Checkpointing OpenSHMEM Programs Using Compiler Analysis

We implement a tool to support the insertion of checkpoints into OpenSHMEM code. It utilizes a compiler liveness analysis to provide check-pointing suggestions (where to checkpoint, what data to checkpoint) to the OpenSHMEM application developer. The tool is based on an open-source compiler framework, LLVM, which is becoming very popular.
